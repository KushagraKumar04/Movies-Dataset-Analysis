# üé¨ Movie Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Movie Data Analysis** repository!!! This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of movie datasets, such as box office performance, genre trends, director impacts, and rating distributions. The analysis is conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for analysis in Google Colab.
- `data/`: Stores datasets used in this project. **Note**: Some datasets may be too large to upload to GitHub directly, so download links are provided.
- `src/`: Includes Python scripts with functions for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- `images/`: Holds any images or visualizations generated during analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

## üìä Datasets

The analysis uses the following datasets:

1. **IMDb Dataset**: Includes information on movies, genres, directors, cast, and user ratings.
2. **Box Office Mojo**: Provides data on box office performance across regions.

*Datasets can be found in the `data/` folder or accessed via provided links.*

## üìà Analysis and Goals

This project aims to explore:

- **Genre Trends**: Most popular genres over time and emerging trends.
- **Director and Cast Analysis**: Impact of directors and lead actors on movie performance.
- **Box Office Analysis**: Correlations between ratings, genres, and box office success.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing audience reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and statistical analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Colab**: For running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning for regression and classification models.
- **NLTK**: For basic Natural Language Processing.
- **Plotly**: Interactive plots for deeper insights.
